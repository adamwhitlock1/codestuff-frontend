Using P5.js I made this simple example of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Everything about it is pretty simple, and it uses the canvas element to draw out the game over time.

[P5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a pretty interesting library for creating interactive programs with graphical elements. I have seen it often times used for games, scientific data display, and other graphically intense applications. At first I was going to try and use Vue with P5, but I kept running into issues with Vue re-rendering and undesirable times, so I went with a more vanilla version of using P5 for this.

[View the source code on github](https://github.com/adamwhitlock1/conways-game-of-life-rollup)

The whole thing is about 95 lines of JavaScript total, and I used [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to bundle the code.

If you are interested in learning to use P5.js you should check out the [Coding Train on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw). The channel is really interesting, and the host Daniel Shiffman is entertaining and fun to watch.
