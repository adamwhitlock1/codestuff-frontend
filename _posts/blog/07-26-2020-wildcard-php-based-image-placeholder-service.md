Having spent the majority of my work hours coding in PHP, via the context of Wordpress, I really wanted to get outside of that realm and build some stuff from scratch.

Wildcard is a simple image placeholder service that provides random images of various creatures. You can get images of cats, dogs, birds, bugs, tigers, lions, fish, and even the occasional potato ðŸ¤«.

To build the api, I used vanilla php, [phrouter](https://github.com/mrjgreen/phroute), and [intervention](http://image.intervention.io/).\
