title: Text selection word search and statistics - Vue
description: Quickly analyze a section of text to find a specific word, and derived stats on the text as well.
---
This CodeSandbox example was a quick proof of concept on how vue could be used to analyze text to provide some basic search and statical data about a section of text.

I did try this on some pretty large pieces of text (the entire Moby Dick novel) and it crashed the browser, so be warned it is just for smaller pieces of text.
