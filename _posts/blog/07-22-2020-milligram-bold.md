Milligram is a great little CSS framework, and I have used it with a few personal projects. I wanted to create a different version of it with some different typography and styling for the form inputs.

In reading about customizing radio buttons and checkboxes, I extended the milligram inputs to be more unique and still accessible. Below is the CodePen that showcases Millgram Bold.
